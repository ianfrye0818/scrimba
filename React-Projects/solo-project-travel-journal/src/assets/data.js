    text: `We had a deposit down on a quick cruise that we were going to take as a mini vacation since we had Disney World planned for 2024. I had fallen in love with roller coasters since then and my siblings had talked about going to Universal during our Disney trip but wouldn't have been able to make it work. I jumped at the opportunity and canceled our cruise and hopped down to Universal for the week. - Side note: we spent ALOT of time at Disney :P`,

This ship was AMAZING from top to bottom and the cruise director, Kyndal Fire, kept the party going all the time.`,

This was a beautiful ship and we went to amazing destinations, although I felt like I had Covid the entire time. (Thankfully I didn't.) Some notable activities included: ziplining in Haiti, Jetskiing in Haiti, and JJ Number 5 in Haiti :P`,
